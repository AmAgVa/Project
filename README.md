# Project
This is a collaborative project by Thu Ha Thai, Amanda Aghai Vafaei, Nathaly Johansson, Simon GÃ¶ransson where datasets from SMHI have been used.

With the use of datasets available from www.SMHI.se the answers were divided into subtasks. Here the work has been approached by the policy A where the release manager controls the flow of pull requests made to the upstream main file.
